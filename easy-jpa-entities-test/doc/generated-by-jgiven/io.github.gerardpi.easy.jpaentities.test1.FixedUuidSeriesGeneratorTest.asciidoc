===== UUIDs generated are formatted with sequence of integers starting at 0 =====

When generating pass:[10] UUIDs +
Then the width of the index part is pass:[8] in the zero based series of pass:[10] UUIDs that was created +

===== UUIDs generated are unique =====

When generating pass:[3] UUIDs +
Then UUID pass:[0] pass:[matches] UUID pass:[0] +
and UUID pass:[1] pass:[matches] UUID pass:[1] +
and UUID pass:[2] pass:[matches] UUID pass:[2] +
but UUID pass:[0] pass:[does not match] UUID pass:[1] +
UUID pass:[2] pass:[does not match] UUID pass:[0] +
UUID pass:[1] pass:[does not match] UUID pass:[0] +

===== UUIDs generated have expected values =====

When generating pass:[5] UUIDs +
Then the UUID at index pass:[0] is pass:["00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"] when represented as text +
Then the UUID at index pass:[1] is pass:["00000001-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"] when represented as text +
Then the UUID at index pass:[2] is pass:["00000002-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"] when represented as text +
Then the UUID at index pass:[3] is pass:["00000003-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"] when represented as text +
Then the UUID at index pass:[4] is pass:["00000004-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"] when represented as text +
